Planning for the filesystem
Class structure:
Filesystem contains blocks, has the functions to interact with the blocks
	allocate entire 4226 block space on image creation
blocks contain data, can be formatted however
	3 varieties of blocks, first is a map, second is an i node, third is a data block
mfs is the user interactable part that collects user input
	the user interacts with the file system by getting files that exist from outside the filesystem image and by putting copies of them into the os's file system
	can manage, save, open, close, and delete file system images
	can also display how much disk space is free
